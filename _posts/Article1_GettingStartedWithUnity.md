## Overview

The Unity version we are going to install is Unity 2017.3.1f. We will start by creating an account and downloading the software. To keep yourself always motivated, have a look at the top selected apps that are [Made with Unity](https://unity.com/madewith).

## Setup

First of all, we need to create account.
Visit [Unity's official website](http://unity3d.com/) and sign up as we will login later on when we install Unity.

After creating an account, you will need to verify it from your email before using it. Once done, Let's proceed to downloading Unity.

Visit the [Unity's Store](https://store.unity.com/) and select the Personal Edition and download the installer.

When installing, you will be given a choice to select and deselect stuff. There is no need to select everything like you usually do.
Let's see what's important. Unity itself is the most important. An IDE too is essential, so choose either MonoDevelop or Visual Studio. I prefer Visual Studio so I choose it. 

You can also select other stuff that might help you like:

* **Documentaion** which is also available online from [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html)
* **Standard Assets** which holds some useful assets for prototyping
* **Example Projects** which contains some sample projects to learn from

Other helpful packages are target platform specific like **Android Build Suppot** and others.

If you don't have the **Work Offline** button, That's because you need to at least login for the first time but later you will find this option when you sign out.

Once done, you are ready to go

Press on the **New** button at the top and create a new project.
Name the project anything you like. Here I named it **MyFirstUnityProject**

The **3D** and **2D** setting can be changed later from inside so it doesn't matter.

Turn off "Enable Unity Analytics" and press **Create project**
